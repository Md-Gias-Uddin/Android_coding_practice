    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
    The tests in this book are similar in length, format and content to the real test, but
    success in these tests will not guarantee success in the real test. It often seems
    easier to work on practice materials than to sit the tests themselves because you
    are not under the same pressure.HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

    Walker never patented his invention, and
    three years later it was copied by a Samuel
    Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers.
    About the same time, a French chemistry
    student called Charles Sauria produced the
    first “strike-anywhere” match by substituting
    white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate
    in the Walker formula. However, since white
    phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845
    match-makers exposed to its fumes
    succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats
    away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the
    substance was eventually banned.
    That was 62 years after a Swedish chemist
    called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red
    or amorphous phosphorus, a development
    exploited commercially by Pasch’s
    compatriot J E Lundstrom in 1885.
    Lundstrom’s safety matches were safe
    because the red phosphorus was non-toxic;
    it was painted on to the striking surface
    instead of the match tip, which contained
    potassium chlorate with a relatively high
    ignition temperature of 182 degrees
    centigrade.
    America lagged behind Europe in match
    technology and safety standards. It wasn’t
    until 1900 that the Diamond Match
    Company bought a French patent for safety
    matches — but the formula did not work
    properly in the different climatic conditions
    prevailing in America and it was another 11
    years before scientists finally adapted the
    French patent for the US.
    The Americans, however, can claim several
    “firsts” in match technology and marketing.
    In 1892 the Diamond Match Company
    pioneered book matches. The innovation
    didn’t catch on until after 1896, when a
    brewery had the novel idea of advertising
    its product in match books. Today book
    matches are the most widely used type in
    the US, with 90 percent handed out free by
    hotels, restaurants and others.
    Other American innovations include an anti-
    afterglow solution to prevent the match from
    smouldering after it has been blown out; and
    the waterproof match, which lights after
    eight hours in water</string>

    One of London Zoo’s recent advertisements caused me some irritation, so
patently did it distort reality. Headlined “Without zoos you might as well tell
these animals to get stuffed”, it was bordered with illustrations of several
endangered species and went on to extol the myth that without zoos like
London Zoo these animals “will almost certainly disappear forever”. With
the zoo world’s rather mediocre record on conservation, one might be
forgiven for being slightly sceptical about such an advertisement.
Zoos were originally created as places of entertainment, and their suggested
involvement with conservation didn’t seriously arise until about 30 years
ago, when the Zoological Society of London held the first formal
international meeting on the subject. Eight years later, a series of world
conferences took place, entitled “The Breeding of Endangered Species”, and
from this point onwards conservation became the zoo community’s
buzzword. This commitment has now been clearh defined in The World Zpo
Conservation Strategy (WZGS, September 1993), which although an
important and welcome document does seem to be based on an unrealistic
optimism about the nature of the zoo industry
